# ✅ Bitcoin Audit Survival Checklist

If you've received a notice from the IRS or state tax authority, follow this checklist immediately:

### 🔍 Before Responding
- [ ] Read the notice **in full** and determine if it's a **6173**, **6174**, or **6174-A**
- [ ] Check the deadline to respond
- [ ] Review past transactions and determine **custodial vs. non-custodial**

### 🔐 Privacy & Preparation
- [ ] Ensure **multi-factor auth** on all exchange/email accounts
- [ ] Consider encrypting or backing up wallets and files
- [ ] Review communications to ensure **no self-incriminating statements** have been made

### 🧾 Document Everything
- [ ] Export all exchange CSV data
- [ ] Export wallet xpubs or seed derivation paths (optional)
- [ ] Organize cost basis by year and wallet

### 🧠 Legal Strategy
- [ ] Decide whether to respond directly or through an attorney
- [ ] Reference **your rights under the 4th and 5th Amendments**
- [ ] If self-custody only, consider asserting “no custodial records exist”

### 📝 Response Letter
- [ ] Customize template response
- [ ] Avoid volunteering unnecessary information
- [ ] Submit via certified mail or secure portal
